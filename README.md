Key Features:

Data Loading and Preprocessing: Includes data loading, handling missing values, and feature scaling.
BIRCH Clustering: Implements the BIRCH algorithm to efficiently cluster large datasets by summarizing data into hierarchical tree structures.
DBSCAN Clustering: Implements the DBSCAN algorithm to identify clusters of varying shapes and densities, effectively handling noise and outliers.
Model Evaluation: Evaluates the performance of both algorithms using metrics such as Silhouette Score, Davies-Bouldin Index, and visualization techniques.
Comparison and Discussion: Compares and contrasts the results of BIRCH and DBSCAN, highlighting their strengths and weaknesses in terms of performance, scalability, and suitability for different data distributions.
